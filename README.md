# Application-of-Statistics-in-an-Unordered-Set

Given predefined values, the basic statistical calculations were
implemented in n number of arrays such as mean, median, mode and
hardcoded histogram per unordered set.

Program was written in C language.

Functions include:
  contains (returns the number of occurences of a given value in a set), 
  getElements (returns the number of elements inside a given set), 
  display (displays the predefined values like #1), 
  displayAll (displays the predefined values like #2), 
  sum (gets the sum of all elements inside a set), 
  mean, 
  median, 
  mode, 
  getSmallest, 
  getLargest, 
  clear, 
  checks if set is empty, 
  printHistogram(displays the Histogram per set)
  
  Display format #1: [5:2] [3:5] [2:6] [2:8]
  Display format #2: 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 6 6 8 8
